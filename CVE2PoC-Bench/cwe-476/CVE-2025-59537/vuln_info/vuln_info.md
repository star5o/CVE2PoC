# CVE-2025-59537

## Overview

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

## Affected Versions

- 1.2.0 through 1.8.7
- 2.0.0-rc1 through 2.14.19
- 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.2.0-rc1
- 3.1.7
- 3.0.18

## Vulnerability Description

With the default configuration (no `webhook.gogs.secret` set), Argo CD's `/api/webhook` endpoint will crash the entire argocd-server process when it receives a Gogs push event whose JSON field `commits[].repo` is not set or is null.

## Technical Details

The `/api/webhook` endpoint is accessible without authentication. When processing Gogs webhook events, the `affectedRevisionInfo` function parses data according to webhook event types (e.g., `gogsclient.PushPayload`), but lacks proper data structure validation. Since `Repository` is a pointer type, a null value causes a panic that crashes the server.

## CVSS Score

7.5 (High)

## Attack Vector

- Network-accessible
- No authentication required
- Low complexity
- Single HTTP POST request can crash the service

## Fixed Versions

- 2.14.20
- 3.2.0-rc2
- 3.1.8
- 3.0.19
