# CVE-2025-49596 - MCP Inspector RCE via Missing Authentication

## Vulnerability Overview

MCP Inspector versions below 0.14.1 are vulnerable to remote code execution due to lack of authentication between the Inspector client and proxy server.

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-49596
- **CWE**: CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)
- **CVSS Score**: 9.4 (Critical)
- **Affected Versions**: < 0.14.1
- **Fixed Version**: 0.14.1

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Start Vulnerable Environment

```bash
cd /path/to/CVE-2025-49596
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Verify Services

After starting, the following services should be available:

- MCP Inspector Client UI: http://localhost:6274
- MCP Proxy Server: http://localhost:6277

## Vulnerability Details

The MCP Inspector proxy server accepts arbitrary stdio commands without validating the request source. An attacker can send unauthenticated HTTP requests to the proxy endpoint to execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

Vulnerable endpoint:
```
GET /sse?transportType=stdio&command=<cmd>&args=<args>
```
