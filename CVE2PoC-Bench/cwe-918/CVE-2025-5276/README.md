# CVE-2025-5276

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in mcp-markdownify-server.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.x with `requests` and `sseclient-py` packages

### Start Environment

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Wait for the build to complete (first run takes several minutes).

### Verify Services

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Both `markdownify-mcp` (port 8000) and `internal-server` should be running.

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerable version (commit 949f12e) does not validate URLs passed to `webpage-to-markdown`, `bing-search-to-markdown`, and `youtube-to-markdown` tools. The `Markdownify.toMarkdown()` function directly calls `fetch(url)` without checking if the URL points to internal resources.

An attacker can request arbitrary internal URLs through these MCP tools, potentially leaking sensitive information from internal services.

## Clean Up

```bash
docker-compose down
```
