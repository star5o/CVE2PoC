# CVE-2025-46001 - Filemanager v2.3.0 Rename Extension Bypass

## Environment Setup

1. Start the vulnerable environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Wait for the container to start (about 10 seconds)

3. Access Filemanager at: http://localhost:8086/filemanager/

## Vulnerability

Filemanager v2.3.0 contains a rename-based extension bypass vulnerability:
- Upload allowed file type (.txt) containing PHP code
- Use rename function with path traversal (`....//`) to move file and change extension
- Achieve Remote Code Execution

## Default Configuration

- No authentication required
- Upload policy: DISALLOW_ALL (only whitelist extensions allowed)
- Vulnerability bypasses this through rename functionality

## Cleanup

```bash
docker-compose down
```
