# CVE-2024-56143 Strapi Private Field Exposure

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Port 1337 available

### Start the Environment

```bash
cd /cwe-639/CVE-2024-56143
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Wait for Initialization

The first startup will take several minutes to:
1. Install npm dependencies
2. Build the Strapi admin panel
3. Initialize the database

Check logs to monitor progress:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f strapi
```

Wait until you see:
```
[INFO] Strapi started successfully
```

### Create Admin User

After Strapi starts, create an admin user via API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:1337/admin/register-admin" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstname":"Admin","lastname":"User","email":"admin@test.com","password":"Admin12345!"}'
```

Or access the admin panel at http://localhost:1337/admin and create the first admin account manually.

### Stop the Environment

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Clean Up Completely

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
