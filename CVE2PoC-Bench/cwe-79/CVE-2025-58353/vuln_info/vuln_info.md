Promptcraft Forge Studio is a toolkit for evaluating, optimizing, and maintaining LLM-powered applications. All versions of Promptcraft Forge Studio sanitize user input using regex blacklists such as `replace(/javascript:/gi, '')`. Because the package uses multi-character tokens and each replacement is applied only once, removing one occurrence can create a new dangerous token due to overlap. The "sanitized" value may still contain an executable payload when used in href/src (or injected into the DOM). There is currently no fix for this issue.
