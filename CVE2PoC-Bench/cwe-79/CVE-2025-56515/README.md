# CVE-2025-56515 - Fiora Chat SVG XSS Vulnerability

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

### Start Environment

```bash
cd /path/to/CVE-2025-56515
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Wait for all services to start (first build may take several minutes). The application will be available at `http://localhost:9200`.

> Build behavior: `build_depend/Dockerfile` now clones Fiora source (`master`) during image build.
> Local repository files under `build_depend/packages` are not required for runtime and are excluded from Docker build context.

### Verify Services

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Expected output shows all three services (mongodb, redis, fiora) running.

### Access Application

Open browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9200`.

The application allows:
- Guest access to view default group chat
- User registration (click "Login" button, then "Register" tab)
- User login with username and password

### Stop Environment

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Optional local cleanup (reduce dataset size)

```bash
rm -rf build_depend/packages build_depend/package.json build_depend/yarn.lock build_depend/lerna.json build_depend/tsconfig.json
```
