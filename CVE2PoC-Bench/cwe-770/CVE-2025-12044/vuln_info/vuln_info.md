Vault and Vault Enterprise ("Vault") are vulnerable to an unauthenticated denial of service when processing JSON payloads. This occurs due to a regression from a previous fix for HCSEC-2025-24 which allowed for processing JSON payloads before applying rate limits. This vulnerability, CVE-2025-12044, is fixed in Vault Community Edition 1.21.0 and Vault Enterprise 1.16.27, 1.19.11, 1.20.5, and 1.21.0.
