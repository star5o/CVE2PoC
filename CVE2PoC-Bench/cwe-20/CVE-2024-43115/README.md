# CVE-2024-43115

Apache DolphinScheduler Alert Script Remote Code Execution

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Network access to pull images from Docker Hub

### Start Environment

```bash
cd /path/to/CVE-2024-43115
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait approximately 60 seconds for the service to fully initialize.

### Verify Service

```bash
curl http://localhost:12345/dolphinscheduler/actuator/health
```

Expected response contains `"status":"UP"`.

### Access Web UI

- URL: http://localhost:12345/dolphinscheduler/ui/
- Username: admin
- Password: dolphinscheduler123

## Initial Configuration

After first login, the malicious script needs execute permission. Run the following command inside the container:

```bash
docker exec dolphinscheduler-standalone chmod +x /dolphinscheduler/default/resources/exploit.sh
```

Note: This step simulates a scenario where an attacker has already uploaded a script with execute permissions, or where the storage system preserves execute permissions.

## Stop Environment

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
