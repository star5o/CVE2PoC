FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. In versions 1.16.0 and above through 1.26.3, an unprivileged attacker can create a new admin user when registration is enabled through the use of a hidden field used only in the user management admin page, new_user_is_admin. This is fixed in version 1.27.0.
