# CVE-2025-44830 - EngineerCMS SQL Injection

SQL injection vulnerability in EngineerCMS v1.02 through v2.0.5 in the `/project/addprojtemplet` interface.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Start Environment

```bash
cd /cwe-89/CVE-2025-44830
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:8092

### Default Credentials

- Preferred: `qin.xc` / `123456`
- Fallback (official v1.03 defaults): `admin` / `123456`

### Stop Environment

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Verification

Run the PoC script to verify the vulnerability:

```bash
cd exp_workspace
python poc.py
```

## Notes

- The vulnerable endpoint requires admin authentication
- The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection
- The binary is from the official GitHub release v1.03
- `build_depend/Dockerfile` downloads the release binary and checks out tag `v1.03` at build time to avoid committing large runtime assets into the dataset repository
