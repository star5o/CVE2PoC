A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in the PluXml CMS theme editor, specifically in the minify.php file located under the default theme directory (/themes/defaut/css/minify.php). An authenticated administrator user can overwrite this file with arbitrary PHP code via the admin panel, enabling execution of system commands.
