# CVE-2025-46557

XWiki Missing Authorization vulnerability allowing any user to change authenticator settings.

## Environment Setup

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait for XWiki to fully initialize (~3-5 minutes, check logs with `docker logs -f xwiki-web`).

## Initialization Steps

1. Access http://localhost:8080/

2. Complete the Distribution Wizard:
   - Step 1: Create admin user (username: admin, password: admin123)
   - Step 2: Select XWiki Standard Flavor and click "Install this flavor" then "Install"
   - Wait for flavor installation to complete (may take 10-15 minutes)
   - Step 3-5: Continue through remaining steps

3. After installation completes, logout or use a different browser/incognito window

## Verify Vulnerability

Access the Authentication Administration page as an unauthenticated user:

```
http://localhost:8080/bin/view/XWiki/Authentication/Administration
```

If vulnerable, the page will be accessible and display authenticator configuration options.

## Cleanup

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
